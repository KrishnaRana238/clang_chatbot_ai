## Optional: Free AI API Setup ðŸš€

To get even more intelligent responses, you can add a free Hugging Face API token:

### Step 1: Get Free API Token
1. Go to https://huggingface.co/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to Settings â†’ Access Tokens
4. Create a new token (free tier: 30,000 characters/month)

### Step 2: Add Token to Your Project
```bash
echo 'HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here' >> .env
```

### Step 3: Enable AI Features
The chatbot will automatically use AI when the token is available!

## Alternative: Local AI Models

For completely offline AI, install transformers:
```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

This will download and run models locally (requires more disk space and processing power).
